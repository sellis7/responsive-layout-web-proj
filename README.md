## Responsive layout web project

_Multi-page website final project completed while attending VWCC_  

Very quickly assembled (roughly within 2-3 evenings) due to time constraints stemming from full time employment  
while enrolled in 3 college-level courses, resulting in the choice to use "lorem ipsum" filler text almost exclusively.  
The image choices, and over-all theme, are a reflection of personal interests and alluring subject matter, all  
respectfully borrowed from the internet.
